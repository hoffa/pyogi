All you need to know is:

- Thick lines are [C notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(musical_note)).
- Circles are naturals (i.e. white keys).
- Triangles are sharps (i.e. black keys).

There are no flats, rests, note values, time signatures, key signatures, etc. Play what sounds good.

## Usage

```bash
./render.sh score.mxl > score.svg
```
